  summary: The 'cnpy' library written by Carl Rogers provides read and write facilities for files
    created with (or for) the 'NumPy' extension for 'Python'. Vectors and matrices of
    numeric types can be read or written to and from files as well as compressed files.
    Support for integer files is available if the package has been built with -std=c++11
    which should be the default on all platforms since the release of R 3.3.0.
